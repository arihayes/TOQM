This is based on the same code as our https://github.com/time-optimal-qmapper/TOQM/tree/main/code project.

The main changes are that I've wrote a new qasm parser, and changed how latency is handled in the code. I added the new "Table" option for the latency setting, which reads a latency table from a user-specified text file.
